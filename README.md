# DungeonGenerator
The goal of my graduation work was to research how a 3D dungeon generator and procedural content generation works. I had no experience with procedural content generation at forehand.
I created my own 3D dungeon generator by combining multiple existing algorithm's. This generator is highly customizable with a lot of different parameters. 
I made a paper around procedural content generation, which explains commonly used algorithms and my process into creating my own implementation.
